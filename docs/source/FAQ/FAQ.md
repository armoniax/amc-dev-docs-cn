### What kind of technology platform is Armonia?

 Armonia is composed of the mother chain (Armonia Meta Chain) and other isomorphic or heterogeneous child chains (Armonia Child Chain). Efficient bidirectional cross-chain of assets is realized between mother chain and child chains as well as among the child chains, forming a mother-child multi-chain technology platform.

### Armonia is a multi-chain platform. How is the mother chain designed?

 Armonia Meta Chain adopts APoS consensus mechanism and WASM virtual machine and is designed with low transaction model and unique account model.

### How are the child chains of Armonia designed?

Armonia's child chains are quickly constructed from the provided L0 SDK, which can be isomorphic or heterogeneous with the mother chain. Other independent public chains such as Bitcoin can also be integrated into child chains, forming a multi-chain architecture altogether.

### Regarding the multi-chain hierarchical structure used by Armonia, how to realize interconnection between chains?

Armonia provides L0-base as a general transaction routing module, which can quickly identify and process running nodes of a single chain.
